## Project Goals

In this project, I aimed to:

- Practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage complex application state.
- Create a user-friendly flashcard-style quiz application.
- Allow users to:
  - Create and manage topics for quizzes.
  - Create and manage quizzes within topics.
  - Create and manage flashcards within quizzes.
  - Interact with flashcards by flipping them over.

## Features

- **Topics Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete topics for their quizzes. Each topic has a name and a unique identifier.

- **Quizzes Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete quizzes within topics. Each quiz has a name, and a unique identifier, and belongs to a specific topic.

- **Flashcards Management**: Users can create, edit, and delete flashcards within quizzes. Each flashcard has a question, an answer, and belongs to a specific quiz.

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Users can interact with quizzes by flipping flashcards to reveal answers, making it an effective study tool.
